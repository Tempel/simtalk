Engineering the Impossible
- in the last 10-15 years, have seen eg. NASA looking to private enterprise, and SpaceX being very efficient with their engineering
- more simulation will be accessible to non-experts, with simplified interfaces like submitting straightforward jobs
- simulation of electric propulsion is tough, due to all the coupled physics (electromagnetics, fluids, structures, control systems)
- high performance computing (HPC) will be important for making bigger models
    - but I think these larger models will require tougher advances in pre- and post-processing - automation of these is important
- will allow integration of hardware development with software development, allowing complete product simulations

- Thought: improvements in rapid prototyping could actually decrease the need for good modelling

Ciera
- no more rule-of-thumb or back-of-the-envelope strategies required
    - use the right tool (eg. power drill today, even if hand cranks were good in the past)
- precise answers are demanded
- ease of file import (cross-communication) and standardization (eg. JEDEC) would "help the industry"

Multiphysics
- errors today come from incomplete boundary conditions, not from too-small models (ie. we have all the computing power, but can't always use it right)
- and a product can't be improved if model error is larger than the expected improvement
- no one person understands all areas of physics; therefore, in the future, no one will be a total modelling expert

High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Ansys can use 4000 cores with a fully linear speed increase, and 18,000 with a speed increase of >80% of linear
    - meshing is less well parallelized, but they're working on it
- statistical combinations of potential changes (?)
- progression of modelling techniques:
    - single solutions > parametric analyses > design of experiments (DoE), response surfaces > goal driven optimization > stochastic methods, design for 6 sigma

Process Automation
- used application customization toolkit (ACT) to make custom wizards and objects for the Quebec dam authority
- during an emergency, anyone with permission can set parameters (eg. water level) and run through a web interface to see current safety factors

Speaking to Simon of the HPC talk
- GM tried to democratize CFD, giving access to CAD people, followed by review by specialists
    - didn't really pan out
    - resulted in the first creation of a highly-simplified Workbench
    - then experts started to like Workbench, and it was expanded to better suit them
- he is working on things where you do a bunch of parametric analyses and fit a response surface to the results
    - this lets non-technical people get quick, accurate results as they don't perform any actual analyses
    - eg. doctor enters patient measurements, gets prosthetic size
    - eg. oil driller enters pressure and stuff, gets when to stop drilling and start pumping
