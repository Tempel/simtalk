# Simulating Everything and its Consequences

Randy Heydon, P.Eng.

<div class="notes">
I want to show you the things that are happening because of computer modelling and simulation, the effect it has on your lives, and where it might go in the future.  I'm a mechanical engineer working at National Steel Car.  I design freight train cars.  Even in such an old industry, modelling and simulation are major parts of the job and continue to drive the industry forward.  And in other industries, they're even bigger business.

# Model

Represents a thing such that you can ask specific questions about that thing

<div class="notes">
Just so we all agree what we're talking about: modelling is as stated here.  It's a very general term, and isn't specific to computers.  An architectural model answers questions about how a proposed building will look.  A fashion model answers questions about how clothing will look on people (although it's not in their interest to answer that *accurately*).

# Simulation

A model that evolves over time.

<div class="notes">
Simulation is taking a model and evolving it over time.  Simple as that.  Frankly, I don't consider that too distinct from modelling, so I'm going to consider both today.  Many interesting models cover phenomena in physics.  For example...

...this hilarious horse simulator I saw on Wikipedia.  Its motions evolve with time, thereby telling you what it's like to ride a horse.  Ostensibly.

But today I'll be focusing on computer modelling and simulation.  The underlying techniques -- mathematical modelling and numerical approximation -- are not new, but modern computing power has made them far more powerful.

In my work as an engineer, I model and simulate extensively.  I do a fair bit of multibody dynamics; I take bodies as rigid masses, make connections between them, and see how they all move.  Here is the output from NUCARS, rail-specific multibody dynamics software, for a [TODO description of video].  Let's see how it goes.

So exciting!  No?  How about this:

Here is a finite element analysis of a knee joint from the Open Knee project that I worked on for my Master's thesis.  The finite element method is used for a number of things, but I use it (both here and in my current work) for finding stresses and deformations of solids under load. [TODO more description]

This is so cool we should watch more simulations!  [TODO more simulations]  So cool!

Okay, so maybe you don't think they're all that cool.  They're not very dramatic and, as you might have noticed, there isn't a whole lot of effort put into cool graphics.  Because all these simulations are focused on science.  For these, it's important that the simulations are very accurate, but only in a very narrow domain.

For example, those railcar simulations of mine only work as long as the train is on the tracks.  If the simulation ever gets cool enough that the train flies of the tracks?  In real life it would look cool, but that's the point where my simulation stops being at all useful.  Instead, the car just... floats off.  [TODO can I get a derailed or otherwise failed simulation?]  Because if you care about the car's performance, derailment is a total failure, and anything happening after doesn't change that fact.  So I don't bother simulating it right.

Now, you've probably figured out that the real purpose of these simulations is not to produce cool videos. [TODO more]
