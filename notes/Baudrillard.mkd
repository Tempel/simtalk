# Notes on "Simulacra and Simulation" by Jean Baudrillard

## Ch 1 The Precession of Simulacra

- "the map precedes the territory"; the representation comes before the real thing
    - and the decay of the map precedes decay of the territory
- "present-day simulators attempt to make the real, all of the real, coincide with their models of simulation"
    - furthermore, difference between real and simulation is lost
    - real is no longer real "because no imaginary envelops it anymore"
